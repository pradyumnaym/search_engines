### Search Engines Project
---

The project is organised into different subfolders. The `crawl` folder contains the crawler, the `website` folder contains the code for the frontend. The `data_preprocessing`, `data_postprocessing`, and `engine_kernel` folders have the information on the retrieval system.

Please refer to the individual READMEs for further information.

## Installation
Please follow the detailed instructions listed in `crawl`. All sub-directories use a common virtual environment, with the packages mentioned in `crawl/requirements.txt`
