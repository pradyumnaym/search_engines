# #### Crawler design
# 
# We now have a frontier of URLs. We now need to carefully crawl all linked webpages while ensuring to only index relevant webpages. 
# 
# **Design of the crawler**: We can see that the crawling process is _network bound_, i.e, the bottleneck is the network latency and the server rate limit. So despite the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock), we can safely use multiple threads within the same python process without any performance issues. For the purposes of small-scale crawling, we do not need multiple processes. This has some advasntages:
# 
# 1. We do not need complex synchronisation mechanisms between different threads. The Python GIL ensures that all shared accesses are safe. (Because threads are _concurrent_, and not _parallel_).
# 2. We can simply use a python list as our shared data structure for the frontier! (List operations  such as append and pop are thread-safe by [default](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108091210/http://effbot.org/pyfaq/what-kinds-of-global-value-mutation-are-thread-safe.htm))
# 
# Enqueuing and dequeueing as simply done through list append and list pop operations. 

MAX_DEPTH = 8                    # Maximum depth to crawl.
TIME_BETWEEN_REQUESTS = 1.25        # Number of seconds to wait between requests to the same domain

# load the frontier URLs

with open('../data/frontier_urls.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    frontier = pickle.load(f)

print(f"Loaded {len(frontier)} URLs from the frontier")

frontier = [(url, MAX_DEPTH) for url in frontier]

current_crawl_state = {
    "frontier": frontier,           # list of URLs to be crawled
    "visited": set(),               # list of URLs that have been crawled (we only store the URL, not the content)
    "failed": set(),                   # list of URLs that have failed to be crawled.
    "rejected": set(),                 # list of URLs that were rejected based on key word relevance
    "last_saved": time.time()       # timestamp of the last save
}

del frontier

# #### Storing the crawl results
# 
# We store the results of the crawl in a `rocksDB` instance, which is a simple key-value store. We use the `rocksdict` library that provides a nice, dict-like interface to the key-value store. This takes care of caching data on memory, and flushing the results to the database as required.

# open the dictionary file
db = Rdict('../data/crawl_data')

def save_state():
    """
    Save the current crawl state to disk as a pickle file.
    """
    db.flush()
    with open('../data/crawl_state.pkl', 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(current_crawl_state, f)

if os.path.exists('../data/crawl_state.pkl'):
    with open('../data/crawl_state.pkl', 'rb') as f:
        current_crawl_state = pickle.load(f)

# #### Crawling
# 
# We use a multi-threaded crawler for the reasons discussed above. Most of the operations we use below are thread-safe except for the following: 
# 
# * The `pop` operation is itself atomic, but we _read_ the length of the list to pop a random URL. This can cause issues and is not thread safe. So we use a mutex lock to ensure only one thread pops at once.
# * Similar to the above, `dict` operations are thread safe, but we need to ensure only one thread reads the dict at a time. So we use another lock.
# * To ensure only one thread saves the state at a time, we use another lock.
# 
# The crawling process is straightforward:
# 1. Pop a URL from the frontier
# 2. Check if enough time has passed since the previous request to the domain.
# 3. If yes, retrieve the contents of the URL
# 4. Extract contents and links from the URL.
# 5. Append the links to the frontier, and save the contents of the URL.


frontier_lock = threading.Lock()    # lock to access the frontier - needed because we read the length - not atomic!
dict_read_lock = threading.Lock()   # lock to read from the dictionary - needed because reads are not atomic
exit_event = threading.Event()      # Event to signal an exit to all threads.

# we can use this to avoid hitting the same domain too frequently across different crawlers
