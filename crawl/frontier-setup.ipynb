search engine related to Tübingen, we need a targeted approach to crawling information from the web. If we were to randomly pick a document from the web, the probability of it being related to Tübingen is practically 0. Starting with a few well-known websites (e.g: facebook, etc) will not be effective, since these websites host information about the entire world.
