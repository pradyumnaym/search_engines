search engine related to Tübingen, we need a targeted approach to crawling information from the web. If we were to randomly pick a document from the web, the probability of it being related to Tübingen is practically 0. Starting with a few well-known websites (e.g: facebook, etc) will not be effective, since these websites host information about the entire world. We will not 'come across' Tübingen-related information easily. \n","\n","So, our goal is to first ensure we collect only information about Tübingen, with as little effort (in terms of number of pages visited) as possible.

Hence, we now try to gather information about Tübingen from OpenStreetMaps.
